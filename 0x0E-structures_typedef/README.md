### Project Description
Learn about structures and `typedef`.

* **0. Poppy** - Define a new type `struct dog` with the given elements. - `dog.h`.
* **1. A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself** - Write a function that initialize a variable of type `struct dog`. - `1-init_dog.c`.
* **2. A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad** - Write a function that prints a `struct dog`. - `2-print_dog.c`.
* **3. Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read** - Define a new type `dog_t` as a new name for the type `struct dog`. - `dog.h`.
* **4. A door is what a dog is perpetually on the wrong side of** - Write a function that creates a new dog. - `4-new_dog.c`.
* **5. How many legs does a dog have if you call his tail a leg? Four. Saying that a tail is a leg doesn't make it a leg** - Write a function that frees dogs. - `5-free_dog.c`.
