*   The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called `main.h` .


### Project Description
Pointers, arrays and strings.

* **0. memset** - Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.
* **1. memcpy** - Write a function that copies memory area.
* **2. strchr** - Write a function that locates a character in a string.
* **Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
* **4. strpbrk** - Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
* **5. strstr** - Write a function that locates a substring.
* **6. Chess is mental torture** -Write a function that prints the chessboard.
* **7. The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire** - Write a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
* **8. Double pointer, double fun** - Write a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
* **9. My primary goal of hacking was the intellectual curiosity, the seduction of adventure** - Create a file that contains the password for the `crackme2` executable.
