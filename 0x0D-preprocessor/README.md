##  Requirements
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` .
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` .
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   You are not allowed to use global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etc… is forbidden unless stated otherwise.
*   You are allowed to use `_putchar` .
*   The `main.c` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h` .
*   All your header files should be include guarded.


### Project Description
Learn about macros and how to include header files.

* **0. Object-like Macro** - Create a header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`. - `0-object_like_macro.h`.
* **1. Pi** - Create a header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`. - `1-pi.h`.
* **2. File name** - Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line. - `2-main.c`.
* **3. Function-like macro** - Write a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`. - `3-function_like_macro.h`.
* **4. SUM** - Write a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`. - `4-sum.h`.
