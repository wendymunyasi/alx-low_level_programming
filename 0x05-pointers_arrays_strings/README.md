### Project Description.
Pointers, arrays and strings.

* **0. 98 Battery st.** - Write a function that takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.
* **1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream** - Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
* **2. 2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read** - Write a function that returns the length of a string.
* **3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them** - Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`.
* **4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear** - Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
* **5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes** - Write a function that reverses a string.
* **6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true** - Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
* **7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half** - Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
* **8. Arrays are not pointers** - Write a function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
* **9. strcpy** - Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.
* **10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers** - Write a function that convert a string to an integer.
* **11. Don't hate the hacker, hate the code** - Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.
