##  Requirements

*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.

### Project Description.
Learning C variables, if, else and while statements.

* **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing** - This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative. - `0-positive_or_negative.c`.
* **1. The last digit** - This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`. - `1-last_digit.c`.
* **2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game** - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. - `2-print_alphabet.c`.
* **3. alphABET** - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. - `3-print_alphabets.c`.
* **4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off** - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. - `4-print_alphabt.c`.
* **5. Numbers** - Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line. - `5-print_numbers.c`.
* **6. Numberz** - Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line. - `6-print_numberz.c`.
* **7. Smile in the mirror** - Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. - `7-print_tebahpla.c`.
* **8. Hexadecimal** - Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. - `8-print_base16.c`.
* **9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success** - Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. - `9-print_comb.c`.
* **10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need** - Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. - `100-print_comb3.c`.
* **11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...** - Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits. - `101-print_comb3.c`.
* **12. Software is eating the World** - Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers. - `102-print_comb3.c`.
