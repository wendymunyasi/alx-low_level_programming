**0x15. C - File I/O**

## Author's Details
Name: *Wendy Munyasi.*

Email: *wendymunyasi@gmail.com*

Tel: *+254707240068.*

##  Requirements
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   You are not allowed to use global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etc… is forbidden unless stated othewise.
*   Allowed syscalls: `read`, `write`, `open`, `close`.
*   You are allowed to use `_putchar`.
*   The `main.c` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`.
*   All your header files should be include guarded.
*   Tip: always prefer using symbolic constants (`POSIX`) vs numbers when it makes sense. For instance `read(STDIN_FILENO, ...` vs `read(0, ...`.


### Project Description
Learn about how to create, open, close, read and write files.
What are file descriptors.
What are the 3 standard file descriptors, what are their purpose and what are their `POSIX` names.
How to use the I/O system calls `pen`, `close`, `read` and `write`.
What are and how to use the flags `O_RDONLY`, `O_WRONLY`, `O_RDWR`.
What are file permissions, and how to set them when creating a file with the `open` system call.
What is a system call.
What is the difference between a function and a system call.


* **0. 0. Print list** - Write a function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list. - `0-print_list.c`.
* **1. 1. List length** - Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list. - `1-list_len.c`.
* **2. Add node** - Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list. - `2-add_node.c`.
* **3. Add node at the end** - Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list. - `3-add_node_end.c`.
* **4. Free list** - Write a function that frees a `list_t` list. - `4-free_list.c`.
* **5. The Hare and the Tortoise** - Write a function that prints `You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n` before the `main` function is executed. - `100-first.c`.
* **6. Real programmers can write assembly code in any language** - Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints `Hello, Holberton`, followed by a new line. - `101-hello_holberton.asm`.
